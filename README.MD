With this framework you can easily develop programs and games for Amstrad CPC either on C or ASM language. It has built-in support for automatic DSK and CDT file creation. Includes programming libraries such as Artaburu's CPCRSLib, cfwi or standard C libraries. It automates the creation of software projects for SDCC and Z88DK compilers with simple shell scripts.
